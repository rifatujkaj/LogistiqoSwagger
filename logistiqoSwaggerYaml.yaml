    An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols,
    routines, and tools that enable different software applications to
    communicate and exchange data with each other. It defines how software
    components should interact and helps to simplify software development by
    abstracting the underlying implementation. APIs are essential for building
    complex and interconnected software systems.
